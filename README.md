## My process


### Built with

- HTML5 markup

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Mozilla Developer Network helped with some CSS properties that I needed while I was styling the project.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools was very useful during the styling process of the project because on top of a good documentation it also has live examples to show you how things work, which is veru helpful.
